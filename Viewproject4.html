üßÅ Donut Delight Scroll Animation UI ‚Äì Figma Project Description :<br>
<br>
This interactive donut-themed UI concept was meticulously crafted using Figma, combining vibrant visuals with scroll-based motion design to create an engaging digital experience. Each screen features a playful 3D donut representing unique flavors ‚Äî Blueberry, Green Apple, and Caramel ‚Äî positioned centrally with bold background color transitions and oversized type subtly layered behind.<br>
<br>
üîß Tools & Techniques Used in Figma:<br>
Auto Layout was utilized for responsive positioning and structured spacing between components.<br>
<br>
Smart Animate transitions were employed in the Prototype tab to create smooth scroll interactions, allowing each donut to elegantly slide into focus.<br>
<br>
The Vector and Pen tools helped in detailing donut shapes and toppings, while blending modes and gradients added depth and gloss for a semi-realistic candy effect.<br>
<br>
Component variants and frame nesting enabled modular donut designs, making it easy to swap flavors while retaining animation behavior.<br>
<br>
Strategic layer masking was applied to insert bold typography behind the donuts, giving the illusion of depth.<br>
<br>
Scroll-triggered animations were achieved using multiple artboards and while scrolling prototype interactions to control timing and transition effects.<br>
<br>
üé® Design Concept & Experience:<br>
The idea was to create a fun, appetizing scroll journey where each new flavor ‚Äúslides in‚Äù as users pull the page upward. This mimics the satisfaction of revealing a new treat, turning a simple scroll into a delightful experience. The typography is bold and playful, reflecting the indulgence of the product, while the soft, gradient backgrounds highlight each flavor distinctly and keep the mood energetic yet elegant.<br>
